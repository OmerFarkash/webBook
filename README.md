# webBook

## description
  In the beggeing, we read the mission fully - we started by writing the web app, when finished moved to android.

  we set down and tried to figure out what needs to be done to accompolished the mission - and how to split the work between us.
  Omer was at the milatery until the 12.2 so Lihi was the leadder and main designer of the proggram.

  we started by designing each page without the functionality behined it.
  After the basic look of the app was funished, we started implementing each part into the program, pisce by pisce.
  we search the web for more information about js + css + json + react - working together for a single run.

  as the program moved forward we add tests for diffrent parts of the proggram.
