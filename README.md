## description
  In the beggeing, we read the mission fully - we decided to start by writing the web app, and whan we finish move to the android app.

  We sat down and tried to figure out what tasks needed to be done to accompolish the mission - and how to split the work between us.
  We opened a new project in Jira and put up any small task we came up with, and orgenised each one to a corresponding Epic.
  Omer was at the milatery until the 12th of Febuary, so Lihi was the leader and main designer of the proggram.

  We started by designing each page without the functionality behined it.
  After designing the Register and Login pages, we moved to the Hom epage, which needed to contane a few components itself - a navigation bar, a left menu bar, and a scrolling posts list.
  we designed each component and built the Home page as a whole.
  When all the pages' designs were done, we started implementing the "Dark Mode" functionality, deciding on the basic color pallete we want to go by, for light mode and dark mode, and adding a toggle to change the apperence of the app on each page.
  After the basic look of the app was finished, we started implementing each part into the program, piece by piece.
  We searched the Internet for more information on how all the different file types (js, css, json, html...) should be delt with, and what each one is responsable for.
  The order of the implemantatin of the parts was according to the users experience in the app - so we first implemented the Register functionality, then the Login functionality, and at the end implementing all the parts in the Home page - adding new post and comments, and editing and deleting them.
  At the end we even added a few difaulf posts to the page to be loaded when the user first enters the app.
  As the program took shape, we add tests for diffrent parts to check if the expected aoutcome is actualy working.
  We made sure to keep updating the Jira as we progresed, and added new tasks as we saw fit.
